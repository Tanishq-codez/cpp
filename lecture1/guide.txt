from lec 63 for solving question use copy to make approach as this will help is solving complex interveiw questions;
add comments for better understanding ;


learn debugging + try to write readable code ;
dry run on revist ; 
after every chunk ask for project from gpt
do it cover all the cases and valid for all numbers ; cases when it can fail
optimise optimise optimise 
is it the best approach + any suggestions->try to find patterns ;
time complexity and space complexity
look in lecture comments
add _ on good questions and ask gpt for some good (leetcode and gfg questions)
